QUESTION: Can you get decode image
  i.Here we need a little think since we have to decode an image. But we have a file udomflag.txt..
so lets look the type of file 

                                                                                                                                                                              
┌──(chain㉿peterChain)-[~/…/tryhackme/cyrange/W2/test]
└─$ file Udomflag.txt   
Udomflag.txt: ASCII text, with very long lines, with no line terminators

We can see the type of file is ASCII text which is normal text. 

ii. so if we open a file with cat command

┌──(chain㉿peterChain)-[~/…/security_related/tryhackme/cyrange/W2]
└─$ cat Udomflag.txt  

The output is wrong weird text but at the end we can see the file is base64..There are two solutions here

1. ONLINE SOLUTION
 since we have a base64 file which we need to conver to image then is googled how to conver base64 to image file i got this site "https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image" os open that text file with editor of your favourite then copy those txt pase then click the button bellow  "base64 to image" Then wait for "MIRACLE"

2. COMMAND LINE:
 we have a text file right? then lets pipe it to make an image.. for my case a made a file known peterChain7.jpg

so lets run the bellow command
    i. Converting the text file to image file name (peterChain7.jpg) 
                                                                                                                                                                
┌──(chain㉿peterChain)-[~/…/tryhackme/cyrange/W2/test]
└─$ cat Udomflag.txt| base64 -d >peterChain7.jpg
     ii. if we list we had an image file called peterChain7.jpg 
                                                                                                                                                                         
┌──(chain㉿peterChain)-[~/…/tryhackme/cyrange/W2/test]
└─$ ls                  
peterChain7.jpg  Udomflag.txt

 iii.  Opening an  image with xdg-open tool                                                                                                                                                  
┌──(chain㉿peterChain)-[~/…/tryhackme/cyrange/W2/test]
└─$ xdg-open peterChain7.jpg 
                                  
GOOD LUCK: Hope you seen something interesting in am image
